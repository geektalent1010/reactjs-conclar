# About Conclár

ConClár is a browser based convention programme guide.

## About the information page.

This is a sample information page. You should customise with an information page specific to your convention.

The information page is composed in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This is a common standard for formatting text that is easy to follow and safer than HTML. There us a handy [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You may edit the provided file, `info.md`, or change the INFORMATION.MARKDOWN_URL setting in `config.json`.
